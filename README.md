# What are these?

These are my styleguide that I use, when writing my own projects and prefer to when working in a team. These 
guides include instructions on how to write and maintain my code, throughout the entire process of my work-flow.

[You can check the entire repo here](https://github.com/aaskorohodov/aaskorohodov), and it's
[Python section here](https://github.com/aaskorohodov/aaskorohodov/tree/main/Python)

# Structure

Guidelines are divided into 2 sections:

1. JavaScript's guidelines (under heavy development)
2. [Python's guidelines](https://github.com/aaskorohodov/aaskorohodov/tree/main/Python) (partially completed)

Each section is designed to include different aspects of writing and maintaining code, using one of these programming
languages and all the required infrastructure.

# Where do I start? 

Each section is divided into several md-files, with names started with the number

- 1_introduction.ms
- 2_ide.md
- ...

You can start by simple following this order.
