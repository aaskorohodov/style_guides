# Structure

Guidelines are divided into 2 sections:

1. JavaScript's guidelines (under heavy development)
2. Python's guidelines (partially completed)

Each section is designed to include different aspects of writing and maintaining code, using one of these programming
languages and all the infrastructure required.

# Where do I start? 

Each section is divided into several md-files, with names started with the number

- 1_introduction.ms
- 2_ide.md
- ...

You can start by simple following this order.
